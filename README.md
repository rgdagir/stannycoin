Introducing StannyCoin. A cryptocurrency designed to create a more open financial system for Stanford students.

We have implemented an ERC20 compliant coin to facilitate the movement of Stanford based assets across the Ethereum blockchain. Whether it’s running out of meal plan dollars at TAP or having to Venmo people for Uber, Stanford students face a myriad of financial issues.

StannyCoin solves this problem by creating a seamless and trustless way to transact between students.
